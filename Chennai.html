<P> Chennai which is formely called as Madras is also a metropolitian city located in Tamil Nadu which is in South India. The place has similar climate as Mumbai since it is also a city located on the coastal side. The only difference between Mumbai and Chennai is that Chennai is located on the eastern coast of India and Mumbai on the western coast of India. The climate is similar to Mumbai. It has the hot and humid climate but one difference is that it is also a tropical climate which means that it can rain anytime which may bring relief to a hot climate but there is still lot of humidity. The language spoken in Chennai is Tamil. It was made as a city by the year of 1639. </P>

<P> The best time in Chennai is much similar to the best time in Mumbai and that is November to February. Note that Chennai will have heavy rains so it is good enough to carry an umbrella during the best time. The other months like the time from March to October is not the best time to visit Chennai is because during March to May it can get very hot and very humid like Mumbai. The monsoon months that is from June to October are characterized by very heavy rainfall which will lead to a problem visiting that place so that is why the best time is November to February. </P>
