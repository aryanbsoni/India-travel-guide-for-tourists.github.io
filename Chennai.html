<P> India is one of the beautiful country in the world. India is known for a diverse country since it has different locations like some cities are settled in sea coast like Mumbai,Chennai, Kolkata,Visakhaptnam. There are places which are located on higher altitude like Indore, Bengaluru,Pune. There are places which are settled on hill stations like Shillong, Mussoorie, Kullu and some places are located in the desert area like places in Rajashtan. So, these factors in India contribute to a diversed country and also it is a beautiful country because it has different cultures and different lifestyles of different places like for example the Kathakali dancers are the famous dancers in Tamil Nadu and the Marathi dance is quite popular in Maharasthra. There are many beautiful places in India like Rajiv Gandhi Zoological Park in Pune, Marina Beach in Chennai, Mysore Palace in Mysuru. The only problem of India is that no matter wherever you go there always will be heat with you. Since India is a developing country, it is also a hotter country but it is cooler than Dubai which is said to be a plus point of visiting India. </P>
