    <h1>Chennai</h1>

    <p>
        Chennai, formerly called Madras, is a metropolitan city in Tamil Nadu, South India. It has a similar climate to Mumbai as it is also a coastal city. The major difference is its location—Chennai is on the eastern coast of India, while Mumbai is on the western coast. Chennai experiences a hot, humid, and tropical climate, which means it can rain anytime, offering relief from the heat but also increasing humidity. Tamil is the primary language spoken here, and the city was officially established in 1639.
    </p>

    <p>
        If you want to travel to Chennai by Air India, it will take 2 hours and 5 minutes. However, traveling by train takes longer—22 hours on the CSMT Chennai Express.

Summers (March to May) can be extremely hot and humid, while the monsoon months (June to October) bring heavy rainfall, which may hinder travel plans.
