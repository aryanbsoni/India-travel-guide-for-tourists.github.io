<P> Mumbai, the capital of Maharashtra is another metropolitian city located in the state of Maharashtra. It is known for the famous food of that place like the "vada pav" and the Marathi tradation of Mumbai. It is a coastal city which is located on the Western coast of India. It is one of the most populated city in India. The city was built during the British Raj Era in 1924. It is also called as the finical capital city of India. In Mumbai there are many slums in most of the areas which tends to make the place quite dirty in India. The offical language of Mumbai is Marathi but in Mumbai people also speak English, Gujrati and Hindi. Also, in Mumbai there are many Gujrati societies like Padmavati Nagar in Mulund West. There are marathi and hindi societies in Mumbai. Mumbai is formely known as Bombay. The Shiv Sena government changed the name from Bombay to Mumbai. </P>
<P> If you want to come to Mumbai then you can come by flight or by train. If you are coming to Mumbai by flight from any other city where you live like for example if you are coming from Chennai International Airport (MAA) to Chatrapati Shivaji International Airport (BOM) by Air India then it will take 2 hours and 5 minutes to reach Mumbai but if you are going by train then it will take a little longer time. The time taken will be almost a day (23 hours and 30 days) through SF Express. If you are going by train then here is the link <a href="https://www.railyatri.in/booking/trains-between-stations?device_type_id=6&from_code=MAS&from_name=MGR+CHENNAI+CENTRAL+&journey_date=01-06-2023&src=tbs&to_code=CSMT&to_name=MUMBAI+CSMT+&user_id=-1685524664&user_token=61685524664&utm_source=tt_dwebhome_search"> </a> but if you are going by plane then <a href="https://www.ixigo.com/flights?utm_source=Google_Search&utm_medium=paid_search_google&utm_campaign=A2b_Routes_Google&utm_source=Google_Search&utm_medium=paid_search_google&utm_campaign=A2b_Routes_Google&gclid=CjwKCAjwg-GjBhBnEiwAMUvNW5T5bAMTVxx3NNiCmIIAPVFCl9BCazKEfmBsV8MrgnKUmD4l0O3WyxoCH1sQAvD_BwE">. </a>
<P> The best time to visit Mumbai is obviously the time when Mumbai is during winters and that is November to January. Although one point of Mumbai is that winters are not as severe as other places but in January it can get as cold as 15 degree celcius but because Mumbai produce hot air you might feel that temperature pleasent. The only problem why we cannot visit Mumbai in other months is because during February to early-June is it is very hot and humid like summers and mid- June to October sometimes early-November it rains too heaviliy that it can get flooded an incident like this occured on 26th July 2005 when Mumbai became fully flooded because of its monsoon rains. So, the eaiser time to visit in Mumbai is pleasent winters. Note that in Mumbai the day temperatures are still hot and humid so better plan to do the tourism trip during evening or after 4:30 PM since evening will be cool and overnights will be pleasent. </P>
<P> There are many places to see in Mumbai and some famous places of Mumbai are- 
1. Gateway of India- Just like the Arch-de-triomphe in Paris, Gateway of India is an arch- monument which was built in the early-20th centuary. It is located in Colaba which is in South of Mumbai. It was built by a scottish architect named "George Wittet" and it was finally constructed in 1924. It gives the viewpoint of Arabian Sea. It  is located on the opposite side of The Taj Mahal Palace and Tower hotel. <BR>
2. Juhu Beach-Juhu Beach is located on the shores of the Arabian Sea. It stretches for six kilometres up to Versova.The short, rocky formations make up the Juhu Beach. It is a tourist attraction throughout the year and is also a destination for shooting films. The beach generally gets more crowded on weekends and public holidays. The food court at its main entrance is known for its 'Mumbai style' street food like bhelpuri, pani puri and sev puri. The beach is among the most popular sites in the city for the annual Ganesh Chaturthi celebrations where thousands of people arrive in grand parade, carrying idols of the Lord Ganesh of various sizes, to be immersed in the sea at the beach. Juhu Beach is also a common spot for plane spotting as a portion of it lies underneath the departure path from Runway 27 and occasionally, the arrival path from Runway 09 of Mumbai Airport. There are several small entrances to the beach throughout the stretch, however the main and most used entrance is near Hotel Ramada Plaza By Wyndham Palm Grove. The best time to visit Juhu Beach is from October to May because during the monsoon period of June to September the tide is mostly high which makes it dangerous to wander around on the beach.  </P>
