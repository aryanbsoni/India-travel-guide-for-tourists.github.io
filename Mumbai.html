    <h1>Mumbai</h1>
    <p>
      Mumbai, the capital of Maharashtra, is a metropolitan city located on the western coast of India. It is known for its iconic food like "vada pav" and the vibrant Marathi culture. As the financial capital of India, Mumbai also boasts a rich history, having been built during the British Raj in 1924. The official language of Mumbai is Marathi, although English, Hindi, and Gujarati are widely spoken. Mumbai was originally known as Bombay, but its name was changed to Mumbai by the Shiv Sena government.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      To reach Mumbai, you can either fly or travel by train. For example, a flight from Chennai International Airport (MAA) to Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport (BOM) takes about 2 hours, while a train ride via SF Express takes around 23 hours and 30 minutes. You can check train details <a href="https://www.railyatri.in/booking/trains-between-stations?device_type_id=6&from_code=MAS&from_name=MGR+CHENNAI+CENTRAL+&journey_date=01-06-2023&src=tbs&to_code=CSMT&to_name=MUMBAI+CSMT+&user_id=-1685524664&user_token=61685524664&utm_source=tt_dwebhome_search">here</a>, and flight details <a href="https://www.ixigo.com/flights?utm_source=Google_Search&utm_medium=paid_search_google&utm_campaign=A2b_Routes_Google&utm_source=Google_Search&utm_medium=paid_search_google&utm_campaign=A2b_Routes_Google&gclid=CjwKCAjwg-GjBhBnEiwAMUvNW5T5bAMTVxx3NNiCmIIAPVFCl9BCazKEfmBsV8MrgnKUmD4l0O3WyxoCH1sQAvD_BwE">here</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      The best time to visit Mumbai is from November to January when the weather is more pleasant. The temperatures in January can drop to around 15°C, though it may still feel warm due to the coastal humidity. Avoid visiting during the summer months (February to June) as the heat can be overwhelming, and during the monsoon season (June to October), heavy rains can cause floods, like the one that occurred in 2005.
