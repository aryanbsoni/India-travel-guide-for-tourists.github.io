<P> The right time to visit Delhi is during the winter months that is late October to mid March. The average weather varies during winters but as the winter months <BR> go on the temperature tends to decrease. According to some sites, it is advisible to avoid to visit during the December and January even tough you are going <BR> at the best time. The reason is because it becomes very foggy, dangerously polluted and very cold which leads to a difficulty in living in that place.

<P> There are many places which you can visit in Delhi some are like-
1. Laal Kila- The Laal Kila place is also known as Red fort in Hindi. The Laal Kila is a momenument located in Delhi. It was constructed by the Mughal Emporer "Shah-Jahan" and it was built by 12<sup>th</sup> May 1638. Many people often visit that place since it is a tourist and a historical place. The fort was stolen of its artwork and jewels during Nader Shah's invasion of the Mughal Empire in 1739. Most of the fort's marble structures were later on destroyed by the British following the Indian Rebellion of 1857. The fort's defensive walls were largely undamaged and the fortress was later on used as a military force. The prime ministers always raise the Indian Flag ever since the 15<sup>th</sup> August of 1947. <BR>
2. India Gate- India Gate is also a monument which is located in Delhi. Many people often visit it since it is a war memorial for many people.
