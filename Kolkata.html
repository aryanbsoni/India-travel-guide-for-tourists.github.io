<B> <U> <CENTER> Kolkata </CENTER> </U> </B>


<P> Kolkata is India's 4th and the last largest metropolitian city. Kolkata is located on the North-Eastern coast of India. It is located on the coast of Bay of Bengal. It is situated in the state West Bengal (Poschim Bongol). In this city the language is Bengali. It was formely known as Calcutta but after the India's Independance year that is 1947 the government changed the name to Kolkata. Kolkata is also the capital of West Bengal. During the British Raj Era Calcutta was the capital of British India. Kolkata was discovered during the era of 14th to the 16th centuary. By the WHO it is said that this place is also a very large and a huge city which is called as <B> Megacity </B>. Kolkata has a similar climate like the coastal cities like Mumbai, Chennai, Visakhaptnam etc. This place is also hot and a humid place. Kolkata follows a tropical climate which means it rains anytime during summers and monsoon. It also has a dry climate like Mumbai as it does not rain during winter. </P>
<P> If you want to go to Kolkata by Air India then it will take 2 hours and 50 minutes but if you want to go by train it will take a little longer time. It will take more than a day to travel which might be quite tiring for you so I suggest you to go by plane. The time taken from Mumbai to Kolkata by train will be 30 hours 30 minutes. <BR> If you want to go by plane here is the link <BR> <a href="https://travel.airindia.in/booking/availability/0"> Travelling to Kolkata by plane </a>. <BR> If you want to travel by train then here is the link <BR> <a href="https://www.railyatri.in/trains-between-stations-v2?from_code=CSMT&from_name=MUMBAI%20CSMT%20&journey_date=06-06-2023"> Travelling to Kolkata by train </a>. </P>
<P> The best time to visit Kolkata is during winters but be alert of rainfall. The best time to visit Kolkata is during winters is because during the months of March to June that is the summers they are very hot and humid which will make you feel uncomfortable, then comes the monsoon months that is June to November which can be very heavy and flooding which might disturb your travelling. So, the best month is December to February that is the winter season since it is pleasently cool. </P>
